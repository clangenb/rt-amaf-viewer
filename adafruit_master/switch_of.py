# Simple strand test for Adafruit Dot Star RGB LED strip.
# This is a basic diagnostic tool, NOT a graphics demo...helps confirm
# correct wiring and tests each pixel's ability to display red, green
# and blue and to forward data down the line.  By limiting the number
# and color of LEDs, it's reasonably safe to power a couple meters off
# USB.  DON'T try that with other code!

numpixels = 300

# Here's how to control the strip from any two GPIO pins:
datapin = 23
clockpin = 24
strip = Adafruit_DotStar(numpixels)

# Alternate ways of declaring strip:
#  Adafruit_DotStar(npix, dat, clk, 1000000) # Bitbang @ ~1 MHz
#  Adafruit_DotStar(npix)                    # Use SPI (pins 10=MOSI, 11=SCLK)
#  Adafruit_DotStar(npix, 32000000)          # SPI @ ~32 MHz
#  Adafruit_DotStar()                        # SPI, No pixel buffer
#  Adafruit_DotStar(32000000)                # 32 MHz SPI, no pixel buf
# See image-pov.py for explanation of no-pixel-buffer use.
# Append "order='gbr'" to declaration for proper colors w/older DotStar strips)

strip.begin()                               # Initialize pins for output
strip.setBrightness(64)                     # Limit brightness to ~1/4 duty cycle

# Runs 10 LEDs at a time along strip, cycling through red, green and blue.
# This requires about 200 mA for all the 'on' pixels + 1 mA per 'off' pixel.

tail = -10             # Index of last 'off' pixel
